# On-Demand-Bus-Scheduling-Using-Static-Booking-Data
This is my Masters Project 
<br>
Our project, Demand-Based Bus Scheduling Using Booking Data , aims to revolutionize the way urban bus systems operate.
By leveraging booking data, users can book rides from one point to another with a specific booking time,enabling a more efficient and user-centered approach to public transportation.

The core of our system involves analyzing booking data to determine the optimal number of buses that is required between various stops and identifying strategic points where buses should be halted. Each bus stop is designed with ample space to accommodate multiple buses in advance, ensuring readiness and flexibility.

The primary goal of our project is twofold: to reduce operating costs for bus operators and to minimize the need for extra buses at any given location, thereby helping to alleviate traffic congestion. By aligning bus availability with actual demand, we aim to create a more efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly public transportation system.
